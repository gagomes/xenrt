Manifests
=========

The tests directory is split into two, the primary part is kept within the
xenrt.hg tree, and the secondary part is outside (in 
/usr/groups/xenrt/distmaster).

The part within the xenrt.hg tree should only contain non binary files, upon
which XenSource holds all the rights. For example, config files for tests, 
simple python scripts to run tests etc. Any binary files or 3rd party code
should be kept in distmaster.

Within the test directory in xenrt.hg there should be a file called Manifest.
The Manifest contains a list of files needed for the test and their md5sums, in
the format "md5sum relative_file_path". If the md5sum is not known (for example
it is a file that can change, such as a key file), then an * can be used.

The Manifest file also has a header, in the following format:

# Description: Short description of the files in this test dir
# Status: NDA / proprietary / downloadable / distributable
# License: GPL / XS / <other>
# Obtaining:
# <text>
# <text>

The four status values mean:
NDA:		Files are supplied to us under an NDA or similar arrangement,
		i.e. we cannot distribute it, and other XenRT users cannot
		purchase/download it
proprietary: 	Files are 3rd party proprietary code that we cannot distribute,
		but a XenRT user can purchase for themselves.
downloadable: 	Files are 3rd party, and license terms prevent us from
		distributing them, but a XenRT user can simply download them
		themselves.
distributable: 	Files are OK to include in a XenRT distribution.

If no header is applied, distributable is assumed.

In the case of proprietary or downloadable files, the text under the
"Obtaining:" header will be used in generating instructions for the XenRT user
as to where to obtain the files from. This should therefore contain any relevant
version information and purchase/download URLs and instructions on processing
any files to match the format in the Manifest.

For distributable files, the License field should be put in with the appropriate
license. XS = XenSource owned code that we are happy to distribute. Other
'standard' licenses can simply be entered in, if the application uses a custom
license, place this in a suitably named file (if it isn't already) and point to
this file in the License field.



There is a utility scripts/buildmanifest which can be run while inside a test
directory. This will simply generate a Manifest file with md5sums of all the
files in the current directory.
