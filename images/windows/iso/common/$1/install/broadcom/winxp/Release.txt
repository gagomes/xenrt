                 Umbrella Installer needs to include additional DLL 
                 files that go with the VBD driver
      Cause:
                 Latest driver and umbrella installer did not have the
                 newly added DLLs

Version 2.10.11 (January 12, 2007)
----------------------------------
   Fixes:
   ===========
   1. Problem:   ( Cont00028127 )
                 W2K364 - Umbrella installer only writes UInstallerVersion 
                 to the 64bit reg
      Cause:
                 When updating the installer project into the newer build,
                 this registry entry was accidentally removed.

      Files:

      Change:

----------------------------------
   Fixes:
   ===========
   1. Problem:   ( Cont00028061 )
                 Umbrealla Installer v10.15.01 does not remove all 
                 folders after a silent uninstall in W2K3 x64 - no SNP
      Cause:
                 This is because of the side effect introduced on the
                 fix for Cont00027870. 

      Files:
                 FixForUpgrade.exe
                
      Change:    
                 Changed the T2.6 Umbrella installer during major upgrade 
                 to not remove 5706 during major upgrade by changing the
                 target parameter instead of the condition

Version 2.10.9 (January 08, 2007)
----------------------------------
   Fixes:
   ===========
   1. Problem:   
                 The application description display for the 
                 management installer was displayed untranslated
                 for all languages. 
      Cause:
                 The description string was not translated up until
                 now.

      Files:
                 BMgmtInstaller.ism
                
      Change:    
                 Translated the strings for all the languages.
                 
   2. Problem:   
                 The hotkey in the Dutch language for the "back"
                 button was not unique.
      Cause:
                 There was a clash in the accelerator hotkey 
                 between the back and next button.

      Files:
                 BMgmtInstaller.ism
                
      Change:    
                 Picked a different accelerator hotkey for the
                 back button.

                 Members During Driver Upgrade
      Cause:
                 When doing major upgrades, the older installer in
                 question (the version mentioned in the bug report)
                 accidentally uninstalls the NDIS VBD client. This
                 changes the instance id when the major upgrade finishes.

      Files:
                 FixForUpgrade.exe
                
      Change:    
                 Updated FixForUpgrade.exe to detect the scenario and
                 skip uninstallting the NDIS VBD client during the 
                 scenario mentioned in the bug.
                 
   2. Problem:   ( Cont00027883 )
                 4401 Driver Installer - Improper Publisher Name 
                 appears in Programs and Features for Vista (German)
      Cause:
                 The company name is displayed with wrong translated
                 string.

      Files:
                 BDrvInst44.ism.
                
      Change:    
                 To fix this, I changed the string table to display 
                 un-translated company name in English. 
                 This is how our NetXtreme installer does           
                 
                 
Version 2.10.7 (December 28, 2006)

                 Silent Install by Feature on IA64 and IA32 Platforms 
                 appears installed but does not install components.
      Cause:
                 The feature hierarchy was not setup right in the 
                 setup design.

      Files:
                 BMgmtInstaller.ism
                
      Change:    
                 Renamed the parent and children feature names in the 
                 setup design and setup the hierarchy correctly. Also
                 set the "required" field on all the features appropriately.

   ===========
   1. Problem:   ( Cont00027491 )
                 Upgrading MgmtApps from 9.4b to 9.7 fails
      Cause:
                 This is because if Rel 8.1 Management Installer installed
                 on the system, the later installer will never prompt for reboot
                 although BASP is installed. Reboot is needed to upgrade
                 BASP.
      Files:
                 Management Installer modules
      Change:

                 BACS and ASF : Short cut link's  right click properties are 
                 different
      Cause:
                 The initial ASFConfig shortcut was only a "dummy" shortcut.
      Files:
                 ASF Installer module
      Change:    
                 Changed the ASFConfig shortcut to have a valid location and path
                 and changed the behavior of the ASFConfig shortcut
      Impact:
                 ASF Installer

   2.  Change:

                 ASF Installer: Cancel installation prompt pops up 
                 when clicking on the "Next" button
      Cause:
                 The condition to advance to the installation was wrong.
      Files:
                 ASF Installer
      Change:    
                 Changed the condition to correctly advance to the
                 installation process
      Impact:
                 ASF Installer
   2. Problem:   ( Cont00027604 )
                 On Vista 64bit, the installation can be completed, but an 
                 ASFconfig folder with the help file is created in the 
                 Program Files (x86) directory. This installer should NOT be 
                 installing any ASFConfig component.
      Cause:
                 The help file was not part of the ASF Config
      Files:
                 ASF Installer
      Change:

                 popup did not properly conditioned to surpress during
                 downgrade

Version 1.1.6 (June 9, 2006)
---------------------------------
   Fixes:
   ===========
   1. Problem:
                 Cont00025098 - Unselecting/Reslecting Bacs/basp causes
                 managment installer to not install chm help file 
      Cause:
                 CHM is a hidden subfeature under BACS, and does not get 
                 selected if BACS is unselected and then implicitly reselected
                 by selecting BASP.
      Impact:
                 Management installer, Umbrella installer
      Files:
                 BMgmtInstaller.ism, Umbrella.ism
      Changes:    
                 Include CHM in BASP feature 
   2. Problem:   Cont00025056 - Upgrading Teton driver installer from a flash 
                 disk prompts the user for a 'Disk 1' 
      Cause:
                 Windows SourceList setting is pointing to the previous 
                 source location
      Impact:
                 Teton driver installer.
      Files:
                 BDrv5706Msm_AMD64.ism, BDrv5706Msm_IA32.ism, BWinInst.dll
      Changes:    
                 1. BWinInst function BInstBRCMSetDrvSrcList was hard 
                    coded for NetXtreme Driver Installer. 
                    Use MsiSourceListAddSource with Product Code
                    property instead to make function generic.
                 2. Added Custom action to call BInstBRCMSetDrvSrcList API of 
                    BWinInst.dll
   3. Problem:   If CIM is installed by 2 products, uninstalling
                 1 product will remove CIM all together. 
      Cause:
                 removal of CIM was done without checking if it 
                 was used by more than 1 product.
      Impact:
                 Management Installer and ASF Installer
      Files:
                 BWinInst.dll
      Changes:    
                 Remove CIM only if it is installed by 1 product.
   Enhancement:
   ===========
   1. Change:
                 Added WSD and ISCSI drivers to Teton driver installer
      Impact:
                 Teton driver installer.

Version 1.1.5 (May 25, 2006)
---------------------------------
   Fixes:
   ===========
   1. Problem:
                 Cont00024992 - BASP Link/Dependency to BACS in Mgmt Apps 
                 Installer Does Not Install BACS 
      Cause:
                 Feature table was re-oraganized to fix some validation errors.
      Impact:
                 Management installer.
      Files:
                 BMgmtInstaller.ism
      Changes:    
                 Include BACS MSM in BASP feature 

Version 1.1.4 (May 24, 2006)
---------------------------------
   Fixes:
   ===========
   1. Problem:
                 Cont00024895 - B57 driver installer for HP fails 
                 during the installation process. 
      Cause:
                 When we build the INF file name, the code was not prepared to
                 deal with W2k3 system as the check included only XP and w2k.
      Impact:
                 NetXtreme driver installer.
      Files:
                 BWinInst\service.cpp
      Changes:    
                 Reversed the INF file name check. If the platform is not AMD64 
                 or IA64, we now assume the platform to be IA32 and build the 
                 INF file name with full path. 
   2. Problem:
                 Cont00024860 - Teton Installer 9.02.02 - yellow bangs after 
                 on 2nd installation with two 5708 cards
      Cause:
                 When VBD is uninstalled after its child nodes, the devices 
                 are enumerated, and caused phantom devices left behind after 
                 uninstallation, which caused the problem on installation 
                 onwards.
      Impact:
                 Teton driver installer.
      Files:
                 BWinInst\internal.cpp, BDrvInstMSM*.ism, BDrv5706MSM*.ism
      Changes:    
                 BWinInstl.dll: Skip enumeration when VBD is uninstalled
                 Installers: Call BInstScanForHardwareChanges before uninstall
   3. Problem:
                 Cont00024941 - Mgmt Apps Installer v9.02.03 Does Not Install 
                 SNMP Interface Agent Correctly
      Cause:
                 Copy and paste error during migration from MSI based project.
                 Registry setting 
                 [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Broadcom\Bcmif\CurrentVersion]
                 has the wrong entries.
      Impact:
                 Management installer (IA32).
      Files:
                 SnmpMsm_IA32.ism
      Changes:    
                 Corrected registry entry.
                  

Version 1.1.3 (May 10, 2006)
---------------------------------
   Fixes:
   ===========
   1. Request:
                 CIM and SNMP are default selected. They should not be selected 
                 by default.
      Cause:
                 The install level for SNMP and CIM were put as 1 in the condition
                 when fixing validation error ICE79.
      Impact:
                 BMgmtInstaller
      Files:
                 BMgmtInstaller.ism
      Changes:
                 Changed install level from 1 to 101 in conditions of SNMP & CIM.
   2. Request:
                 BACS files were not removed after uninstall if previously
                 upgraded from version 7 of BMgmtInstaller.
      Cause:
                 Component ID was changed from version 7 to version 8 
                 while the keyfile remained the same.
      Impact:
                 BMgmtInstaller
      Files:
                 BacsMSM_IA32.ism
      Changes:
                 1. unset bacs.exe as the key file
                 2. add new registry key under HKCU to be the key path
                 3. change shortcut to non-advertised and set the target to bacs.exe
   3. Request:
                 BDrv5706 failed to install on W2K
      Cause:
                 Condition of Installing NDIS custom action does not include W2K
      Impact:
                 BDrv5706  Installer
      Files:
                 BDrv5706Msm_IA32.ism
      Changes:
                 Corrected the condition in custom action.
   4. Request:
                 File extraction failed if temp folder name has an extra dot, 
                 which caused the installation failed because DIFxAPI.dll is missing
                 from the temp folder.
      Cause:
                 BWinInst.dll failed to handle this use case.
      Impact:
                 BWinInst.dll
      Files:
                 BWinInst\internal.cpp
      Changes:
                 added support for the temp folder with an extra dot in the name.
   5. Request:
                 Silent.txt not up to date with new product code.
      Cause:
      Impact:
                 All installers
      Files:
                 Silent.txt files in all projects.
      Changes:
                 Updated product codes.

Version 1.1.2 (April 20, 2006)
---------------------------------
   Enhancement:
   ===========
   1. Request:
                 Support changing MSI package file name in buildscript.
      Cause:
                 Management installer has 2 different MSI package file names 
                 depending on the product configuration.
      Impact:
                 Buildscript, Management installer, Umbrella installer
   2. Request:
                 Changed BACS uninstall registry to use product code property 
                 instead of hard coded product code.
      Cause:
                 Since the registry had hard coded the product code, it has 
                 to be changed every time a major upgrade is done.
      Impact:
                 Management installer BACS MSMs
   Fixes:
   ===========
   1. Request:
                 Matched component ID with old projects, shared components.
      Cause:
                 For proper reference counting by Windows.
      Impact:
                 All installers
      Files:
                 All project files containing components
      Changes:
                 ID and shared property of components
   2. Request:
                 Moved Microsoft_DLL_IA32 component from BACS and SNMP 
                 to standalone MSM.
      Cause:
                 We are matching component ID and therefore we cannot have 
                 2 MSMs using the same component ID (build error).
      Impact:
                 Management installer, BACS MSM, SNMP MSM, Umbrella installer
      Files:
                 BMgmtInstaller.ism, BacsMSM_IA32.ism, SnmpMsm_IA32.ism, 
                 MicrosoftDllMsm_IA32.ism, BMgmtInstaller.xml,
                 Umbrella.ism, Umbrella.xml
      Changes:
                 Moved the reference to Microsoft_DLL_IA32 component.
   3. Request:
                 Changed product codes for major upgrade.
      Cause:
                 Feature and component tables have been changed from 
                 pre-MSM projects, so minor upgrade from the already 
                 released softwares would fail.
      Impact:
                 All installers
      Files:
                 All MSI project files
      Changes:
                 Product code
   4. Request:
                 Old 5706 installer has only 1 cab files, while the new MSM 
                 based 5706 installer has 4 cab files. It should only contain
                 1 cab file.
      Cause:
                 Most projects uses "one cab per component" option for custom 
                 compression, while the old 5706 installer uses "one cab per 
                 feature" option.
      Impact:
                 5706 driver installer
      Files:
                 BDrv5706.ism
      Changes:
                 change from "one cab per component" to "one cab per feature".

---------------------------------
   Enhancement:
   ===========
   1. Request:
                 Moved BASP upgrade reboot message for Umbrella from 
                 BMgmtInstaller to Umbrella project.
      Cause:
                 
      Impact:
                 Management and umbrella installer.
   Fixes:
   ===========
   1. Request:
                 Custom action for upgrade BASP reboot message was never executed;
                 the existing message we saw after upgrade was actually from the 
                 BASP removed custom action.
      Cause:
                 Conditions for the custom actions were not correct.
      Impact:
                 Management installer
      Files:
                 CustomActionMSM_IA32.ism, CustomActionMSM_IA64.ism, CustomActionMSM_AMD64.ism
      Changes:
                 Fixed the conditions for custom actions.


Version 1.1.0 (April 12, 2006)
---------------------------------
   Fixes:
   ===========
   1. Request:
                 CQ# 20614
      Cause:
                 A registry was deleted after uninstallation.
      Impact:
                 Teton driver installer.
      Files:
                 BDrv5706.ism, BDrv5706Msm_AMD64.ism, BDrv5706Msm_IA32.ism
      Changes:
                 Display reboot message after uninstallation.

Version 1.0.1 (March 29, 2006)
---------------------------------
   Fixes:
   ===========
   1. Request:
                 Changed MSI package name for NetXtreme driver installer.
      Cause:
                 Regressed when creating new product config for 
                 MSI/MSM split-up.
      Impact:
                 NetXtreme driver installer.

Version 1.0.0 (March 29, 2006)
---------------------------------
   Fixes:
   ===========
   1. Request:
                 CQ# 24157
      Cause:
                 Cancelling during uninstall causes uninstall issues in Golfers
      Impact:
                 Management installer.
      Files:
                 BMgmtInstaller.ism
      Changes:
                 Cancel button is disabled once uninstallation is confirmed 
                 and started. Cancelling in the middle of uninstallation 
                 is not supported.
   Enhancement:
   ===========
   1. Request:
                 Extracted NetXtreme driver installer
                 functionality in to a separate MSM.
      Cause:
                 MSI/MSM split-up.
      Impact:
                 NetXtreme driver installer.
