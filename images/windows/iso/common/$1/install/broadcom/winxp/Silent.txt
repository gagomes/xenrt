REBOOT=ReallySuppress to the end of the corresponding upgrade or uninstall command listed above. 
Note that for setup command, please use:   setup /s /v"/qn REBOOT=ReallySuppress"

In some circumstances, reboot is required before uninstallation can continue. If you used REBOOT=ReallySuppress to suppress the reboot,
