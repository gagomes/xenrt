The Windows native install framework uses WinPE to bootstrap
the installation process. To create the files needed to PXE
boot WinPE perform the following steps:

1. Install a copy of Windows Longhorn or Windows Vista.

2. Install the Windows AIK.

3. Copy the files and sub-directories in this directory to
   the c:\winpe on the Windows machine.

4. Edit startnet-x86.cmd in the tools directory.

5. Run winpe.cmd on the Windows machine, supplying an 
   output directory and architecture.

   e.g. c:\winpe\winpe.cmd c:\x86 x86

   To create the x86 WinPE files.

6. Perform step 4 for both x86 and amd64 architectures.

7. Copy boot.sdi, bootmgr.exe and pxeboot.0 to the pxe
   subdirectory of the native test directory. These files
   are the same for both x86 and amd64 architectures.

8. Copy the BCD file from the x86 and amd64 output 
   directories to pxe/32 and pxe/64 respectively.

9. Copy the winpe.wim image files to winpe32.wim and
   winpe64.wim in the XenRT images directory.
