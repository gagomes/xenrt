6.0 Known Issues
==========================

1.  In Windows, deletion of a virtual disk, followed by creation of a virtual disk
    without initialization may result in a blue screen when attempting to format.

    Workaround - Fast initialization of the drive (the default option when creating a disk) 
    before formatting will prevent this issue.  As mentioned in the PERC5 Users Guide, 
    please initialize all disks before usage, unless attempting data recovery.
