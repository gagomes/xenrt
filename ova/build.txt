How to build the XenRT OVA
==========================

1) Clone build.hg somewhere

2) Go to build.hg/myrepos, and clone dom0.hg

3) Run: ln -s /path/to/xenrt.hg/ova/patches/build /path/to/build.hg/.hg/patches

4) Run: ln -s /path/to/xenrt.hg/ova/patches/dom0 \
              /path/to/build.hg/myrepos/dom0.hg/.hg/patches

5) Go to build.hg, and type hg qpush -a

6) Go to dom0.hg, and type hg qpush -a

You now have a copy of the build system with the XenRT changes applied.

7) Go to build.hg, and type (replacing # with the build number):
   make OVA_DISK_G=20 OVA_MEM_MB=2048 BUILD_NUMBER=# xenrt-build

This should go away and build you a xenrt.iso, which will be placed in 
output/xenrt/xenrt.iso
