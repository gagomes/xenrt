This directory contains kickstart template files that the carbonguest
test can use to generate a kickstart config for vendor guest installs.
The test will also add a "%post" section for its own use so don't
use one in these files as well.

A number of variables can be filled in by the test. These are:

%DISTROURL% - The URL for the distribution
%ETHDEVICE% - Ethernet device to use (usually eth0)
%ROOTPASS%  - root password
%TIMEZONE%  - TImezone
