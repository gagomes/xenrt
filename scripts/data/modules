# This file contains a list of modules to add to an initrd when a certain
# module exists in /etc/modprobe.conf. This is a hack, originally put in
# place to workaround the missing mptscsih module in systems with MPT
# Fusion SCSI controllers (only mptbase was being loaded)
#
# Format is:
# <existingmodulebasename>: <extramodule1> <extramodule2> ...
mptbase: mptscsih
