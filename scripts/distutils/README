This directory contains utility files that we are not allowed to distribute,
but that are essential to core parts of the operation of XenRT.

Where possible, we have automated the download of these tools in utils.mk,
however in some cases this is not possible. Instructions on how to obtain
these files are shown below:

devcon.exe / devcon64.exe
-------------------------
The DevCon command line utility is a scriptable alternative to the Windows Device Manager. Within XenRT these are used as part of driver installation on
older version of Windows.

The tools can be obtained from the Windows Driver Kit (WDK), available at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/hh852362.aspx

devcon64.exe is the renamed x64 version of DevCon.


certmgr.exe
-----------
The certmgr tool is used to install necessary certificates when running against e.g. test signed drivers.

It is available from the Windows SDK at http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=8279
